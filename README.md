#Music Theory Toolbox
This is a simple web application that allows you to play with pitch class sets (tones, intervals, chords, scales, etc.), ie. the concepts from [Music Set Theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_theory_(music)‎).

It runs at http://bzamecnik.github.io/music-theory-toolbox/ and is licensed under the MIT license. The author is Bohumír Zámečník. Many thanks go to the authors of the utilized libraries: jQuery, Twitter Bootstrap, Underscore.js, Font Awesome.

If you'd like to visualize such a pitch class circle from any music in real-time take a look at the [HarmonEye](http://harmoneye.com/) application.
